## Shingeki no Kyojin Escape from Certain Death Visual Novel

  This repository consistis in documenting the Shingeki no Kyojin Escape from Certain Death Visual Novel translation.
I am documenting the japanese text alongside the english translation, so you will see the japanese text line and below it the english translation.

  First of all, I have started playing Levi's route and for that you HAVE to choose to play as girl(å¥³æ€§). If you choose your gender as male you will be paired with Mikasa (that I haven't translated anything yet).
Since this doc will be used as base to auxiliate me when start patching the game, there are some text lines that are not written on the doc.These parts consists mainly on onomatopoeias, short answers or some character repeating the same words they said some time ago. It will NOT affect your game play experience or make you lose important information.
When you are on the SURVEY parts ( the point and click on the area you currently are) there is no correct order to click the interest points, so click as you wish and search on the doc the correct translation. I've documented all the shining points, so you should find the translation of everything.
On the choices parts, I will indicate which one I chose, because I am ( at this moment) only translating the choices I make ( but on the future I will translate everything)

  Besides, english is NOT my native language and neither is japanese, so there may be some translation errors or some words spelled wrong. Note that this doc IS NOT the final version of my translation. If you find any error, please contact me at:
